<h1>Visualizing Algorithms</h1>


The best way to understand complex data structures is to see them in action. 
We've developed interactive animations for a
variety of data structures and algorithms. 
Our visualization tool is written in javascript using the HTML5 canvas element,
and run in just about any modern 
browser  -- including iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad, and even the web browser in
the Kindle!  (The frame rate is low 
enough in the Kindle that the visualizations aren't terribly useful, but the tree-based
visualizations -- BSTs and AVL 
Trees -- seem to work well enough)

<h1> How to Use the Visualizations </h1>


This visualizations are meant to be fairly self-explanatory, though there are some subtleties for advanced usage.   
Take a look at a
typical visualization, for Binary Search Trees:

<h2> Algorithm Specific Controls </h2>
</br>
At the top of the screen (boxed in red in the above screenshot) are the algorithm specific controls -- these will change 
depending upon
what algorithm you are visualizing.  In this example, you could insert, delete, or find an element in the BST
 by entering text in the    
appropriate field and either pressing return or clicking the relevant button.  The tree can be printed by
 clicking the print button.
Once you give a command, the visualiztion will start, and can be controlled by the general animation 
controls at the bottom of the screen.


<h2> General Animation Controls </h2></br>


<ul>
<li> <em style="color:blue"> Skip Back</em> If you are in the middle of an animation, this button will completly undo the current 
command.  If you are
not in the middle of an animation, this button will undo the previous command </li>
</br>
<li><em style="color:blue"> Step Back</em> 
This button is only active if you have paused the current animation (using the play/pause button).  
Step back
one step in the current animation.  If you are not currently animating, step back into the previous command. 
 You could use this button
(with sufficient keypresses) to back up through the entire history of everything you've done </li>
</br>
<li><em style="color:blue"> Play/Pause</em> 
Toggle between play mode (in which the algorithm runs free until it completes) and paused mode (where you need to
press 
the Step Forward or Step Back button to advance the animation) </li>
</br>
<li> <em style="color:blue"> Step Forward </em> 
This button is only active if you have paused the current animation (using the play/pause button), and the current
animation 
has not yet completed.  Step
forward one step in the current animation. </li></br>

<li> <em style="color:blue">Skip Forward </em> This button is only active if the current animation has not completed.  
Skip to the end of the current animation
</li>
</br>
<li> <em style="color:blue">Animation Speed (slider)</em> 
Change the speed of the animation.  The value of this slider is saved in a cookie, so you should
only need to set it once 
if you have a preferred speed</li>
</br> 
<li><em style="color:blue">w, h, Chnage Canvas Size</em> 
Change the width / height of the display area.  While the change is immediate, the animations will
not be centered in this 
new field until you reload the page.  This will clear out the currnet animation, but the width and hight values
are also 
saved in a cookie, so you should only need to change this field once, and then everything should work well if you are 
on
a smart phone or a desktop with loads of screen real estate.
</li></br>

<li> <em style="color:blue">Move Controls</em> Toggle between the 
general controls being at the top or bottom of the webpage</li>

</br>


Note that it can be easy to confuse yourself by 
stepping forward an backwards through an animation -- you can confuse the <em style="color:blue">next</em>
step in the animation with the
 <em style="color:blue">previous</em> step, and misunderstand how the algorithm works.  You may wish to only step
forward when you are
 first delving into a particular algorithm.
